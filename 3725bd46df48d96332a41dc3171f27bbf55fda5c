This logic is not needed anymore there, it is only valuable for the tests.\n\nThere is a bit of repetition in the code of `getModifiedPaths`, but I am not sure if it is worth trying to abstract `getModifiedPaths` to handle both PatchList and `Map\u003cString, FileDiffOutput\u003e`. Furthermore, the method will need to become public (or maybe package protected?) to be used in the tests.",
