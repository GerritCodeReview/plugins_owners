      "message": "It is being used in 2 places:\n1. in line #103 where it is obtained from change resources anyway so no change there\n2. in line #118 where `currentFilePaths` is called - previously it called `ChangeData.Factory.create` from change to obtain the `ChangeData` and AFAICT `ChangeResource` calls similar method `this.changeData \u003d changeDataFactory.create(notes);` but from notes - now having said that I believe it works as otherwise a bunch of IT tests would fail as we expect paths there to be present e.g. `GetFilesOwnersIT.shouldReturnOwnersLabelsWhenNotApprovedByOwners`\n\nWDYT?",
